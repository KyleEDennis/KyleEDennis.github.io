                     <h2>Invitation for low-engagement users</h2>

                     <p>Based on various telemetry (including whether customers open the onboarding links they receive via email), we can identify users that are low-engagement and low-uptake, and proactively email them to help.</p>
                     
                     <h3>Focus:</h3>
                     <p>Taking disinterested or non-tech people, and pulling them into a friendly chat with a real human. We also want to convey that we're reaching out to them because we care, and want to help them get the most out of their purchase or gift.</p>
                     
                     <p>The email includes multiple setups:</p>
                     <ul>
                        <li>Reinforcing that Alfred has wide functionality&mdash;and that people can find niche use-cases for it&mdash;might make otherwise disinterested customers curious whether there is a niche in their life it could fill.</li>
                        <li>Asking about how they currently use Alfred allows for a natural segue into how they could use it better. </li>
                        <li>Asking about how they would like to use Alfred allows for us to find and reveal use-cases that we already support but that the customer isn't aware we do.</li>
                        <li>Mentioning that we'll also answer any questions they have enables the additional support objective, and also establishes that we want this to be a general chat rather than just a data-collection survey.</li>
                     </ul>

                     <p><strong>How can we help? Let us count the ways!</strong></p>
                     
                     <p>Hi <em>[first name]</em>,</p>
                     
                     <p>Our team hopes that you've been enjoying your new Alfred&mdash;in whatever way that might be!
                     You see, we've found that the XS Alfred is many things to many people. Whether it be as a personal assistant, kitchen helper, study partner, personal DJ, or Smart Home butler, we've seen Alfred put to all sorts of uses, and we couldn't be more proud.</p>
                     
                     <p><em>[Insert/link a funny use of Alfred]</em></p>
                     
                     <p>We're reaching out to you today for that very reason. We'd like to hear about how you use (or don't use) Alfred in your daily life, how you'd like to use it, and what we can do to make it even better.</p>
                     
                     <p>Rather than send a survey, though, we thought we'd hear from you directly! If you have time for a friendly chat, just let us know by clicking the link below, and a member of our team will give you a call. And, while we're on the phone, we can also try to answer any questions you might have.</p>
                     
                     <p>We hope to hear from you soon!</p>
                     
                     <p>Cheers,</p>

                     <h2>Invitation for dissatisfied users</h2>
                     
                     <p>If a user is taking one of our satisfaction surveys and gives substantial negative feedback, we can use that as an opportunity to understand what's going on and improve the user's experience. When it registers the negative response, our survey can dynamically substitute its normal closer with one designed specifically to initiate a Galahad call.</p>
                     
                     <h3>Focus:</h3>
                     
                     <p>Appealing to a combination of both tech-adverse skeptics and disappointed power-users by asking for their opinion, possibly making them feel like they've been selected because of their special insight.</p>
                     
                     <p>From there, when they start telling us a more detailed story of their experience, we can try to engage on pitfalls they may have run into, and ways that we might improve it.</p>
                     
                     <p>However, we also don't want to make them feel harassed or put-upon for having a negative opinion, or that we're going to pester them until they express a positive one.</p>
                     
                     <p>Another possible concern is that by engaging in this dialogue after they've just given their opinion, their opinion might be less malleable, and they may feel defensive of it. E.g., "I just said that it was a piece of junk, that's my position, and I can't just flip-flop because some nice person on the phone talked me into it!"</p>
                     
                     <h3>Survey Closer:</h3>
