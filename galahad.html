                  <p>Our team is piloting a new program where we reach out to users who aren't taking well to the XS Alfred. We hope that these calls will help users better understand Alfred, and how it might be useful in their daily lives. The ultimate goal is to improve user satisfaction and engagement.</p>

                  <p>The two types of users we'll be reaching out to are low-engagement users and dissatisfied users. Each type of user is given a different callback form, and the type will be identified for you at the start of the call with a label saying <strong>"PROJECT GALAHAD"</strong>. Choose the appropriate user type below:</p>
                                    
                  <div class="alert alert-info">
                     <strong>Tip:</strong> The following scripts are guidelines. Don't fight with customers for control of the conversation, and try to integrate these talking points naturally.

                  <h3><em>[Dropdown Section]</em> Dissatisfied users</h3>
                  
                  <p>Dissatisfied users have left negative feedback on our product survey. These users could range from tech-averse individuals who are confused by or suspicious of Alfred, to power users who are disappointed by what they feel to be limited functionality.</p>
                  
                  <p>The survey indicates that the three largest pain points for dissatisfied users are:</p>
                  
                  <ul>
                     <li>Low utility
                        <ul> 
                           <li>Viewing Alfred as a novelty</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Limited features
                        <ul>
                           <li>Poor handling of long or complex questions, including inaccurate Answers</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                     <li>Spotty speech recognition
                        <ul>
                           <li>Having to raise their voice, repeat questions, etc.</li>
                        </ul>
                     </li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>When these users complete the survey, the last page is changed to one that encourages them to reach out to us via a callback form: </p>
                  
                  <div class="alert alert-secondary">
                     <p>Thank you for your feedback on the XS Alfred. We're working to make Alfred better every day.</p>
                  
                     <p>We'd love to hear more about your experience with Alfred. If you have additional feedback or questions, or need help with your Alfred, click here, and a member of our team will call you directly.</p>
                  </div>
                  <p>While on the call, remember to take notes, so that you can summarize the conversation in the case notes. Be prepared for pushback or frustration from these users, but be friendly.</p>
                  
                  <div class="alert alert-danger">
                     <p>Things to avoid:</p>
                     
                     <ol>
                     <li><strong>Big Brother XS.</strong> Don't say or imply that we're reaching out to them based on monitoring of their Alfred usage. It is ok to say that we're reaching out because of their negative feedback on our survey.</li>
                  
                     <li><strong>XS Knows Best.</strong> Don't say or imply that they're just using Alfred wrong, and that they need to use it better. We're making the case for Alfred, not punishing them for having a negative opinion.</li>
                  
                     <li><strong>The Church of XS.</strong> Avoid sounding like you're proselytizing, and don't over-promise how accepting Alfred into their lives will change everything.</li>
                     </ol>
                  </div>
                  
                  <h3>Part 1: Technical issues</h3>
                  
                  <p><em>"To start off with, has everything been working right for you? Any technical issues or questions that I can try to help with?"</em></p>
                  
                  <p>Start the call by checking to see whether the user's dissatisfaction is driven by unresolved technical issues or an incomplete setup.</p>
                  
                  <p>This may also reveal issues that the user might have with basic familiarity and operation, such as not using a trigger phrase before trying to ask it questions. For example: <em>"I keep asking things like Alfred, what time is it?', but it never responds!"</em></p>
                  
                  <p>Once you've performed any necessary troubleshooting and established that Alfred is set up and working properly, move on with the call.</p>
                  
                  <h3>Part 2: Usage so far</h3>
                  
                  <p><em>"We're sorry to hear that your experience with Alfred hasn't been positive. Could you tell us more about that? Has any particular feature been frustrating for you?"</em></p>
                  
                  <p>Understanding the issues that the user has been having with Alfred allows us to find ways that we can try to improve their experience. If they say that they've tried to use a certain feature, but that it didn't live up to their expectations, or seemed like too much of a hassle, we can ask probing questions about their usage and provide helpful user education. For example:</p>
                  
                  <table align="left" class="table table-bordered">
                    <thead class = "table-info">
                      <tr>

                        <th scope="col" width="50%">Possible response</th>
                      </tr>
                    </thead>

                      <tr>
                        <td><em>"I got it to use in the kitchen, but when I ask it for recipes I don't really like them."</em></td>
                        <td><em>"Oh, I'm sorry to hear that. Although, if you want to use other recipes that you find online, I can show you how to use your phone or tablet to send them to Alfred. I've also found that it's really helpful for managing shopping lists and kitchen timers."</em></td>
                      </tr>
                      <tr>
                        <td><em>"Look, I'm going to be honest, I unplugged the thing. It creeps me out that it's listening all the time."</em></td>
                        <td><em>"I understand. If you have questions about privacy with Alfred, though, I can try to give you some more details about how the system works and how we handle your data."</em></td>
                      </tr>
                    </tbody>
                  </table>
                  
                  <p>Once you've covered their current usage, move on with the call.</p>
                  
                  <h3>Part 3: Other features</h3>
                  
                  <p><em>"In an ideal world, how would you like to use Alfred? Is there anything that you'd like Alfred to be able to do for you? Have you tried...?"</em></p>
                  
                  <p>After we've explored how they're already using Alfred, we can try to help users find features that they weren't aware of, or that they weren't sure might be helpful. Start by asking if there's anything that they'd like to use it for. If they mention something that is already a supported feature, help educate them on it.</p>
                  
                  <p>Once they've discussed how they'd like to use Alfred, you can also make suggestions that they might not have thought of yet. The features below are the ones most likely to drive user retention. Focus on the ones you think will be most relevant to this user, and <strong>skip any that were already discussed</strong>:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Music/Music controls</li>
                     <li>Weather</li>
                     <li>Alarm</li>
                     <li>Timers</li>
                     <li>Smart Home <strong>(only if the user mentions they have smart devices or they express interest in learning more about this)</strong></li>
                  </ul>
                  
                  <p>If you've covered major features, you can also suggest some that the user might not be aware of. Probe their response to some of the following features, and provide more details on a given feature if they seem interested:</p>
                  <ul>
                     <li>Answers</li>
                     <li>Fun and personality</li>

                  <h3><em>[Dropdown Section]</em> Low-engagement users</h3>
                  
                  <p>Low-engagement users haven't been using our series of onboarding emails, and seem slow to adopt Alfred. They may be confused or intimidated by Alfred, or they may have received it as a gift, or they may have simply forgotten that it's there. For these users, we add an alternate email to the onboarding series, which encourages them to reach out to us via a Click-2-Call form.</p>
                  
                  <p>While on the call, remember to take notes, so that you can summarize the conversation in the case notes.</p>

                     <ol>
                     <li><strong>Big Brother XS.</strong> Don't say or imply that we're reaching out to them because we've been watching their usage and have decided it's too low.</li>

                  <p>Start the call by checking to see whether the user is being held up by technical issues that they haven't done troubleshooting for yet, any aspect of basic setup that they haven't been able to complete, etc.</p>
                  
                  <p>This may also reveal issues that the user might have with basic familiarity and operation, such as not using a trigger phrase before trying to ask it questions. For example: <em>"I keep asking things like ‘Alfred, what time is it?', but it never responds!"</em></p>
                  
                  <p>Follow normal knowledge base troubleshooting steps for any issues the customer identifies.</p>

                  <p><em>"How have you been using Alfred so far? What do you use it for most often? Have any of the features stood out to you, good or bad?"</em></p>
                  
                  <p>Understanding the customer's current usage can tell us a lot about both how they're using Alfred, and how they want to use it. If they've tried a basic feature, we can suggest ways that they can make their experience with it even better. Or, if they say that they're disappointed with a feature, we can suggest ways in which Alfred might be more useful for them. For example:</p>
