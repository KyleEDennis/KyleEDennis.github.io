                    <p>If your Pixelbook seems to be running slow or having other software issues, and you've attempted all other troubleshooting options, it may help to reset it.</p>

                    <p>There are two types of resets that can impact your data and accounts differently. Make sure you understand the difference before deciding which reset to perform on your device.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Hard reset</li>
                        <li>Factory reset (also known as "Powerwash")</li>
                    </ul>

                    <h2>Hard reset</h2>

                    <p>Performing a hard reset can help resolve certain issues, like a slow-running device. Once you initiate the hard reset, your device will fully shut down before restarting. All programs will be closed, any unsaved data will be lost, and your operating system (OS) will go through the full startup process.</p>

                    <p>A hard reset will not remove your accounts or personal data from your device, although it is possible that some local files (or changes to those files) might be lost if not properly saved. See <a href="#related_articles" class = "text-info">Related articles</a> for more information on saving and backing up your information before proceeding.</p>

                    <h3>Hard reset your device</h3>
                    <ol>
                        <li>Turn off your device by holding down the Power button, or selecting the time in the bottom right and choosing Power.</li>
                        <li>Wait 1 minute.</li>
                        <li>In laptop mode: While pressing and holding the Refresh key, tap the Power button.<br/>
                        In tablet mode: Press and hold the Power button + Volume up button for 10 seconds.</li>
                    </ol>

                    <h2>Factory reset ("Powerwash")</h2>
                    <p>Perform a factory reset when you want to make your device run like new again. For instance, you may want to factory reset if you are transferring ownership of the device to another person.</p>

                    <p>Performing a factory reset erases all the information on your device's hard drive, and gives Chrome OS a fresh start. This will remove all accounts, settings, apps, personal information, and locally saved files, including all the files in your Downloads folder.</p>

                    <p>Before you factory reset, make sure to back up your files on Google Drive or an external hard drive. The factory reset won't delete any of your files on Google Drive or an external storage device. For more information on saving files, see <a href="#related_articles" class = "text-info">Related articles</a>.</p>

                    <p>Note: If you're using your device at work or school, you can't reset it on your own. <a href="#" class = "text-info">Ask your administrator</a> to wipe the data on your device and re-enroll the device on your work or school network.</p>

                    <h3>Before you factory reset your device</h3>

                    <h4><em>[Dropdown Section]</em> Step 1: Make sure you should reset</h3>

                    <p>You might want to reset your device if:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>You see the message "Reset this Chrome device"</li>

                        <li>You've tried restarting your device and it's still not working normally</li>
                        <li>You want to change the owner of the device. For more information on changing device owners, see <a href="#related_articles" class = "text-info">Related articles</a>.</li>

                    <h4><em>[Dropdown Section]</em> Step 3: Back up your files and info</h3>

                    <p>A factory reset erases all the information stored locally on your device's hard drive, including your settings, apps, and files. Before you reset, make sure to:</p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>Sync your information and settings to your Google Account.</li>
                        <li>Back up your files on Google Drive or an external storage device.</li>
                    </ul>

                    <p>For more information on syncing account settings and backing up files, see <a href="#related_articles" class = "text-info">Related articles</a>.</p>

                    <p>The factory reset won't delete any of your files on your Google Drive or an external hard drive.</p>
